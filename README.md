# home-cfg
This is my main computer config files, all that i use inside linux is right here.

(I will change the config to nix with home manager, but for now I'm using what I already had).

# System
For the distro i'm using NixOS

# Dotfiles
Inside package, inside will live all my configuration for different programs (which is $HOME/.config in user cases)
